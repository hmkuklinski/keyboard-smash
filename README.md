![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7e6a6a1-1b2e-4065-9127-7e50003acc07)

<div align="center">
A fun game to guess the random sequence of the keyboard smash.

## The Rules:
Select four characters/symbols/letters that you'd like to test and then hit Enter. 

NOTE: Forbidden characters include: ; % \

You'll get feedback on whether the letters you entered are in the correct place or need to be moved. You'll have 15 tries to get it right. If you don't figure it out, the culprit will get away!

You will need to have a C compiler to run this program.

```gcc --version ```

If it is not installed, you can install it through these commands:

Linux: ```sudo apt install build-essential``` or ```sudo apt install gcc```

Mac: ```xcode-select-install```
